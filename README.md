# Viajes Compartidos

This project belongs to the Final Project of the Angular Seminar.

It has been generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.0.

We have started from the WEB 2 project, which consists of "Viajes Compartidos Ruta 226", which contains two tables: travels and cars, adapting it to the needs of Angular.

Two APIs have been created from MOCKAPI, to take the data and display it in the corresponding tables.

Travel API: https://6382ba376e6c83b7a985c74e.mockapi.io/api/v1/share_trips
Car API: https://6382ba376e6c83b7a985c74e.mockapi.io/api/v1/cars

Also, a travel reservation cart has been added.
